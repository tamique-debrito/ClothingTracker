This app is meant to facilitate tracking clothing and other textile usage. It's especially helpful when you have many clothes or other textiles that can be used multiple times before washing and you (e.g. jeans, coats, bath/kitchen/sink towels, and some kinds of sweaters). Oftentimes, I find that I prefer to wear a different thing every day, which can make it difficult to keep track of how many times I've worn something without washing it. The purpose of this app is to help with that. It can also be used for related purposes such as keeping track of tasks that should be done once in a while, but might not be easy to remember when you last did them (e.g. changing a water filter every X months) if doing things like this on a relatively consistent schedule is a priority for you.
I also plan to expand this to track clothing usage and organize common outfits I like.

Here's a screenshot of the app:
